## My Background

I don't come from a CS background. This is only me second formal CS course. I'm studying Math-Physics, so I haven't used credit space to take more than the minimum CS required by my major. However, CS is a big part of most sciences these days. Thus, I had to learn Python and use it in the research setting. After working with Dr. Devine this summer, I learned a few things about myself. First, graduate school and a career in physics academia isn't in the cards for me. At least, I need some self-exploration in industry first. Second, I have a knack for coding, and I enjoy the puzzles that come along with it. These new self discoveries have lead me to consider a career in computer science post-graduation.
