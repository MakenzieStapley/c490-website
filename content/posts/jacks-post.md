# a reflection on CSC490-22
Describe the experience: what did you hear, see, read, and do?

My student experiences in CSC-490 existed, for the most part, in a shell. Between jumping around directories in my computer's file system with <code>cd</code> during a live demonstration and creating bash scripts in [vim](https://www.vim.org/about.php), it's evident that a few command line arguments were necessary to progress through the course. I created a quick reference table for several key commands I didn't want to forget. Admittedly, <code>man \[command name\] is far more informative. In any case, here's my table:
| Command      | Action | Modifiers |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| pwd      | print working directory |        |
| ls   | list contents of current directory | -l(ong) -a(ll) -R(ecursive) -h(uman readable) -S(ort, decreasing, by size) |
| cd   | change directory | . current dir, .. parent dir, - most recent dir, ~ home dir |
| mkdir   | make directory |        |
| rmdir   | remove directory |        |
| rm   | remove file | ==Note: Permanent== -i(nteractive) |
| file   | display file properties |        |
| touch   | create file |        |
| mv   | move file |        |
| cp   | copy file | -t(ranspose) makes directory first arg, source(s) after       |
| cat   | read from file |        |
| echo  | effectively, print \[thing\] | echoing into other things can be destructive |
| ==man==   | displays manual for given command        |        |
| clear   | clears terminal display |        |
| curl/wget   | grab files from url |        |
| sudo   | super user do |        |
| grep   | filter stream or file        | -e(grep)      |
| egrep   | filter stream or file with regEx |  |





While a decent chunk of course content involved learning how to navigate around 




How has the experience increased your curiosity or awareness about new ideas or techniques?

How has the experience helped you apply or transfer your learning to a new context? How has this classroom experience built upon the rest of your education? In what ways has your learning empowered you to explore new parts of software development?

Though, I'm no Bourne-again user. Having taken the computer science capstone Software Engineering course only last semester, I came into this course already familiar with the idea of version control, Git use, and limited command line experience (such as piping commands and using grep).

What aspect of the classroom experience contributed most to your learning, and why?
What new insights did you develop regarding your career plans as a result of this class?
How would you describe this class experience to a potential employer in a way that synthesizes knowledge and skills gained?
