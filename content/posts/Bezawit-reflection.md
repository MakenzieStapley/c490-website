### Why I joined this class 

I joined this class because I was interested in learning more topics on computer science, software development. When Dr. Rosoff introduced the class in the previous class, I was taking with him, a spark of curiosity was created in me, and that spark is turning into a flame of desire to learn and explore more, now that I have taken the class. 

Joining this class, I had no prior experience to any of the topics we covered: the Linux operating system, bash script, git and GitHub, and visual studio code. But now I can confidently say I know how to get around through these working environments. I have written some bash scripts such as this [bigfiles.sh](https://github.com/BezawitKassaye/c490-website/blob/ae7cbb46c130e7b4df25c649ef55c91771c58ce5/content/bigfiles.sh) that can look at a directory and detect the biggest five files, which can be useful to see if we want to clean up some space and want to know what is taking up the most space. I also contributed to this website that you are reading this from using the combination of GitHub, visual studio code and my command terminal, with the help of Hugo. Hugo is a static website generator that is written in Go, which I was introduced to in this class as well. 


### What I learnt

I learnt how to access files and get around my computer from the command line, as well as write a script to do what I want in a more organized way. I learnt how to grant access to execute and read files, which was something that I did not know how to do. In fact, I remember getting a pdf that I could not open because of its privacy and converting it to a word document just to convert it back to a pdf, in order to have access to it. But now that I know how to do this from the command line, I believe that won't be a problem anymore. 

I also learnt what git and GitHub is and will try and use it instead of saving my document multiple times with different names just to make sure not to lose the previous version that I worked on. The powerful thing for me is not only that I get to save different versions of the same file but the fact that I can share my work with peers who might be working with me. I think it is a really nice thing to have in a collaborative project, that one person can work on a code separately on a different branch from the main branch without affecting each other’s work and if needed rebasing and merging it to get to the latest version whenever needed. Although it is helpful for collaboration, I find it sort of sad as it shows how software developers are very individualistic and only collaborate through the network only. And with this kind of system there really is no incentive for these people to ever meet and work together because they can do it all through the network. Regardless of what I think about this, I still think that this knowledge I gained from the limited time of exposure I had to git and GitHub is going to be useful in a working environment as well as for my own personal projects. 

I also think that this could be a really useful tool to learn as a computer science student, as it makes it super helpful to collaborate with peers and help each other out with study groups or so. I would probably argue this portion of the class should be something that should be given right after CSC-150, so that students can make use of it for the rest of their college experience. 

I also used to use Spyder as an IDE but now I feel comfortable with Visual studio code, and I will probably use it more for other projects as it has much more user-friendly interface with more applications. It’s debugging abilities, and shortcut commands and the way it smoothly works with the Linux terminal are also perks it has that I will definitely be taking advantage of. I am currently working on learning another programming language as well, and the extensions on Visual studio code would make this the platform for me to use. 

I am currently reading the book "Linux for dummies" to just learn more about the Linux system and about bash scripting because this class implanted that seed of interest in me. I had so much fun working with scripts and am interested in learning more about it. 

Personally, the aspect of the classroom that best assisted my learning where the assignments, both the bash script writings as well as the ones that we had to complete in class following the instructions on canvas. This is because it gave me independence in exploring more on my own to learn more, while not leaving me completely alone as Dr. Rosoff as well as peer students where there for me to ask questions whenever I felt stuck without taking away the sense of control I felt from the independence of the work. I learn best when I have a task to complete, but the freedom to do it by referring to as many sources as I need. This is because when I am looking for how to do a certain thing through different sources, I not only learn what I was seeking to learn but I also learn other things on the way as I accidentally will be encountering other topics related to what I was searching for in my browser. 

Overall, this class was a useful and wonderful ride of 4 weeks, where I got to learn so much in such a limited time. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone in the future.

##### How I would share this to my future employee: 
"I have an experience working on the Linux operating system and bash scripting. I also am familiar with git and collaborative workspace GitHub that would be useful to work with colleagues."
